We travelled night and day, arriving here at about five o’clock. Lord Godalming went to the Consulate to see if any telegram had arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel--“the Odessus.” The journey may have had incidents; I was, however, too eager to get on, to care for them. Until the _Czarina Catherine_ comes into port there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world. Thank God! Mina is well, and looks to be getting stronger; her colour is coming back. She sleeps a great deal; throughout the journey she slept nearly all the time. Before sunrise and sunset, however, she is very wakeful and alert; and it has become a habit for Van Helsing to hypnotise her at such times. At first, some effort was needed, and he had to make many passes; but now, she seems to yield at once, as if by habit, and scarcely any action is needed. He seems to have power at these particular moments to simply will, and her thoughts obey him. He always asks her what she can see and hear.

Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.', 'We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was very good but thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter, and he said it was called “paprika hendl,” and that, as it was a national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I don’t know how I should be able to get on without it.\n\nHaving had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states, Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina.']"
What is the Golden Krone Hotel like?,"The Golden Krone Hotel is described as thoroughly old-fashioned, which suggests it has a traditional and possibly rustic charm.

Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle. The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I thought it was “An hour less than the time.” Then turning to me, he said in German', '_5 May.

There are many odd things to put down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they called “robber steak”--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple style of the London cat’s meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.', 'and gladness, made a discovery. The room was empty! It was barely furnished with odd things, which seemed to have never been used; the furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms, and was covered with dust. I looked for the key, but it was not in the lock, and I could not find it anywhere. The only thing I found was a great heap of gold in one corner--gold of all kinds, Roman, and British, and Austrian, and Hungarian, and Greek and Turkish money, covered with a film of dust, as though it had lain long in the ground. None of it that I noticed was less than three hundred years old. There were also chains and ornaments, some jewelled, but all of them old and stained.']"
What significance does St. George’s Day hold in the context of the narrative?,"In the context of the narrative, St. George's Day is significant because it is described as the eve of a time when ""all the evil things in the world will have full sway."" This sets a foreboding tone and suggests that the night is associated with supernatural occurrences and dangers. The character's distress about the impending night indicates that it is a time of heightened fear and superstition, which adds to the overall atmosphere of tension and unease in the story. The mention of St. George's Day also ties into themes of folklore and the supernatural, as it is a time when traditional beliefs about evil and protection come to the forefront, influencing the characters' actions and feelings.","['data_files/Dracula.txt', 'data_files/Dracula.txt', 'data_files/Dracula.txt', 'data_files/Dracula.txt']","['“It is the eve of St. George’s Day. Do you not know that to-night, when the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?” She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the rosary round my neck, and said, “For your mother’s sake,” and went out of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still round my neck. Whether it is the old lady’s fear, or the many ghostly traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual.

This tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly beloved son. ‘He was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.’ Really, Mr. Swales, I don’t see anything very funny in that!” She spoke her comment very gravely and somewhat severely.\n\n“Ye don’t see aught funny! Ha! ha! But that’s because ye don’t gawm the sorrowin’ mother was a hell-cat that hated him because he was acrewk’d--a regular lamiter he was--an’ he hated her so that he committed suicide in order that she mightn’t get an insurance she put on his life. He blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that they had for scarin’ the crows with. ’Twarn’t for crows then, for it brought the clegs and the dowps to him. That’s the way he fell off the rocks. And, as to hopes of a glorious resurrection, I’ve often heard him say masel’ that he hoped he’d go to hell, for his mother was so pious that she’d be sure to go to heaven, an’ he didn’t want to addle where she was. Now isn’t that stean at any rate”--he hammered it with his stick as he spoke--“a pack of lies? and won’t it make Gabriel keckle when Geordie comes pantin’ up the grees with the tombstean balanced on his hump, and asks it to be took as evidence!”\n\nI did not know what to say, but Lucy turned the conversation as she said, rising up:--', 'I had hardly come to this conclusion when I heard the great door below shut, and knew that the Count had returned. He did not come at once into the library, so I went cautiously to my own room and found him making the bed. This was odd, but only confirmed what I had all along thought--that there were no servants in the house. When later I saw him through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the dining-room, I was assured of it; for if he does himself all these menial offices, surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them. This gave me a fright, for if there is no one else in the castle, it must have been the Count himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here. This is a terrible thought; for if so, what does it mean that he could control the wolves, as he did, by only holding up his hand in silence. How was it that all the people at Bistritz and on the coach had some terrible fear for me? What meant the giving of the crucifix, of the garlic, of the wild rose, of the mountain ash? Bless that good, good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck! for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever I touch it. It is odd that a thing which I have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help.

Sometimes he sheered off the subject, or turned the conversation by pretending not to understand; but generally he answered all I asked most frankly. Then as time went on, and I had got somewhat bolder, I asked him of some of the strange things of the preceding night, as, for instance, why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue flames. He then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the year--last night, in fact, when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway--a blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has been concealed. “That treasure has been hidden,” he went on, “in the region through which you came last night, there can be but little doubt; for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the Wallachian, the Saxon, and the Turk. Why, there is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men, patriots or invaders. In old days there were stirring times, when the Austrian and the Hungarian came up in hordes, and the patriots went out to meet them--men and women, the aged and the children too--and waited their coming on the rocks above the passes, that they might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches.

"In the context of the narrative, what significance does the term 'Ordog' hold for the protagonist as they embark on their journey?","In the context of the narrative, the term 'Ordog,' which means 'Satan,' holds significant weight for the protagonist as they embark on their journey. It reflects the ominous atmosphere and the superstitions surrounding them, indicating that the protagonist is entering a place filled with fear and dark folklore. The mention of 'Ordog' alongside other terms related to evil, such as 'pokol' (hell) and various words for werewolves or vampires, suggests that the protagonist is acutely aware of the dangers and the supernatural elements that may be present in the unknown territory they are about to explore. This awareness adds to the sense of dread and foreboding as they leave the inn and venture into a world that is not only unfamiliar but also potentially hostile and filled with malevolent forces.","['data_files/Dracula.txt', 'data_files/Dracula.txt', 'data_files/Dracula.txt', 'data_files/Dracula.txt']","['When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him talking with the landlady.

I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not cheering to me, for amongst them were “Ordog”--Satan, “pokol”--hell, “stregoica”--witch, “vrolok” and “vlkoslak”--both of which mean the same thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is either were-wolf or vampire.

The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey ere the whole mass had vanished.\n\nWith their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise. Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit. Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbit-hunting in a summer wood.', 'Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which affected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to jump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace.

This was not very pleasant for me, just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the box-seat--“gotza” they call them--cracked his big whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on our journey.']"
Why the Hospadars no fix things for fear of the Turk?,"The Hospadars did not repair the roads for fear that if they kept them in good order, the Turks would think they were preparing to bring in foreign troops, which could hasten the war that was always on the verge of breaking out.

Here, too, when they came, they found the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame, till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the desert.

Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.']"
What connection does the character's journey from London have with the setting described in Bistritz?,"The character's journey from London to Bistritz is significant as it sets the stage for the events that unfold in the story. Bistritz is described as an old place with a tumultuous history, located near the Borgo Pass, which leads into Bukovina. This setting is crucial because it is the gateway to Count Dracula's castle, where the character, Jonathan Harker, is traveling to meet the Count. 

Harker's journey reflects his transition from the familiar, modern world of London to the mysterious and superstitious atmosphere of Transylvania. The description of Bistritz, with its historical significance, old-fashioned hotel, and the presence of local customs and superstitions, contrasts sharply with Harker's previous life in London. This contrast heightens the sense of foreboding and sets the tone for the supernatural elements that will emerge as the story progresses. 

Additionally, Harker's preparation for the journey, including his research at the British Museum, indicates his desire to understand the land and its customs, which foreshadows the challenges he will face in the unfamiliar and potentially dangerous environment of Bistritz and beyond.","['data_files/Dracula.txt', 'data_files/Dracula.txt', 'data_files/Dracula.txt', 'data_files/Dracula.txt']","['It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease.\n\nCount Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and said, “The Herr Englishman?” “Yes,” I said, “Jonathan Harker.” She smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves, who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with a letter:--', 'My surmise is, this: that in London the Count decided to get back to his castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from the castle by Szgany, and probably they delivered their cargo to Slovaks who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped for London. Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to arranging the carriage of the box up some river. When this was done, and he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought, by murdering his agent.\n\nI have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the Slovaks to have ascended is either the Pruth or the Sereth. I read in the typescript that in my trance I heard cows low and water swirling level with my ears and the creaking of wood. The Count in his box, then, was on a river in an open boat--propelled probably either by oars or poles, for the banks are near and it is working against stream. There would be no such sound if floating down stream.\n\nOf course it may not be either the Sereth or the Pruth, but we may possibly investigate further. Now of these two, the Pruth is the more easily navigated, but the Sereth is, at Fundu, joined by the Bistritza which runs up round the Borgo Pass.

It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle. The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock my own disappointment.

What was Watson's role in the unexpected marriage ceremony involving Irene Adler and Godfrey Norton?,"Watson's role in the unexpected marriage ceremony was that of an unintentional witness. He was half-dragged to the altar by Godfrey Norton, who needed a witness due to an informality about their marriage license. Watson found himself mumbling responses and assisting in the marriage of Irene Adler to Godfrey Norton without prior knowledge of what was happening. After the ceremony, both the bride and groom thanked him, and Irene Adler even gave him a sovereign as a token of appreciation.","['data_files/The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.txt', 'data_files/The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.txt', 'data_files/The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.txt', 'data_files/The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.txt']","['“‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do.

It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.”\n\n“This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said I; “and what then?”', '“I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden.

She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man.

"What experiences did Jonathan Harker have in Bistritz that reflect the themes of fear and the supernatural, particularly during his journey to meet Count Dracula?","In Bistritz, Jonathan Harker's experiences reflect themes of fear and the supernatural in several ways. Upon his arrival, he notes the town's stormy history, including past sieges and devastating fires, which sets a foreboding tone. The mention of the town's violent past contributes to an atmosphere of unease.

When Harker arrives at the Golden Krone Hotel, he is greeted by a peasant woman who seems to expect him, suggesting a sense of predestination or fate that adds to the supernatural elements of his journey. The fact that he is being awaited implies that his arrival is significant, possibly linked to the dark forces associated with Count Dracula.

Additionally, Harker's reflections on the transition from the West to the East during his travels evoke a sense of crossing into a realm that is unfamiliar and potentially dangerous. His observations about the landscape and the cultural differences heighten his feelings of isolation and vulnerability.

As he prepares to travel to Dracula's castle, there is a palpable sense of dread. The mention of needing to sanctify places to combat the ""nest of vipers"" suggests an awareness of the evil he is about to confront. This foreshadowing, combined with the eerie atmosphere of Bistritz and the surrounding Carpathian mountains, amplifies the themes of fear and the supernatural that permeate his journey.","['data_files/Dracula.txt', 'data_files/Dracula.txt', 'data_files/Dracula.txt', 'data_files/Dracula.txt']","['It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a very interesting old place.

Whaat are the connections between the character's journey in London and the supernatural elements mentioned in the narrative?,"The character's journey in London is closely intertwined with the supernatural elements of the narrative, particularly through the character of Count Dracula. As the Count arrives in London, he brings with him the supernatural abilities and characteristics that define him as a vampire. These include his ability to transform into a bat or wolf, his lack of reflection, and his need to feed on the blood of the living to sustain his existence.

The journey to London represents a significant shift in the narrative, as it marks the Count's attempt to expand his influence and find new victims in a bustling urban environment. The supernatural elements manifest in various ways, such as the Count's ability to move undetected, his manipulation of mist, and the eerie occurrences that follow him, which create a sense of dread and foreboding among the characters.

Additionally, the character of Jonathan Harker, who initially encounters the Count in Transylvania, becomes a key figure in the unfolding events in London. His experiences and observations serve as a bridge between the ordinary world and the supernatural, as he grapples with the reality of the Count's powers and the threat they pose to those around him.

Overall, the connections between the character's journey in London and the supernatural elements highlight the clash between the mundane and the otherworldly, as the characters confront the terrifying implications of Dracula's presence in their lives.","['data_files/Dracula.txt', 'data_files/Dracula.txt', 'data_files/Dracula.txt', 'data_files/Dracula.txt']","['the devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he cannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never! He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again Jonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand--witness again Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him from the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at the window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create--that noble ship’s captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself.

Whilst I was placing them in order I heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room, and as I passed through, noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp lit, for it was by this time deep into the dark. The lamps were also lit in the study or library, and I found the Count lying on the sofa, reading, of all things in the world, an English Bradshaw’s Guide. When I came in he cleared the books and papers from the table; and with him I went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts. He was interested in everything, and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its surroundings. He clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the subject of the neighbourhood, for he evidently at the end knew very much more than I did. When I remarked this, he answered:--\n\n“Well, but, my friend, is it not needful that I should? When I go there I shall be all alone, and my friend Harker Jonathan--nay, pardon me, I fall into my country’s habit of putting your patronymic first--my friend Jonathan Harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me. He will be in Exeter, miles away, probably working at papers of the law with my other friend, Peter Hawkins.

You must meet her at the station.

When I have returned you will be master of all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep them safe, for there is in them much of treasure.
